        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The GitHub repository alu-zero_day focuses on teaching basic computer security concepts. 
            It likely deals with the concept of zero-day vulnerabilities, which are flaws in software 
            that are not known by the developers and can be exploited by attackers. 
            This project is important for understanding how to protect computer systems and networks from potential threats.
