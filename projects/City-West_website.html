        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The GitHub repository City West Website is focused on the development of a website for a resto-bar, named City West View. 
            The website showcases various services provided by the bar, such as food and room bookings, menus, event schedules, and customer feedback options. 
            It enables customers to place orders directly through the site and make room reservations, providing a smooth, interactive experience.

            The project is built using Python and web technologies, ensuring it works as an effective platform for the resto-bar to manage customer orders, 
            room bookings, and showcase their offerings.
